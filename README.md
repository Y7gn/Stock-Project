# Flutter and Spring Boot Project

This project combines a Flutter frontend with a Spring Boot backend. It serves as a template for building cross-platform applications with a Java-based backend.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `flutter_app`: Contains the Flutter project for the mobile app.
- `springboot`: Contains the Spring Boot project for the backend API.

## Getting Started

### Flutter Frontend

1. Navigate to the `flutter_app` directory:

    ```bash
    cd flutter_app
    ```

2. Ensure Flutter dependencies are installed:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the Flutter app:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Spring Boot Backend

1. Open the Spring Boot project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

2. Run the Spring Boot application.

   - The default API endpoint is `http://localhost:8080/api/stocks`.
